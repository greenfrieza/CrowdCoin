# CrowdCoin

"kickstarter"-type smart contracts with multi-page React (w. nextjs) front-end and mocha tests.

Anyone can create a Campaign to ask for funding, then funders can vote on proposals to distribute you the money in tranches (e.g. to complete tasks: order components, hire marketing etc.). Stops the proposer running off with money or under-delivering as in traditional kickstarter.


It's deployed on Rinkeby here: 0x24b2b002b66AEFbd6237394C6B0393eacb5d84d6
